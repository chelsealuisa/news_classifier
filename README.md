==============================

A toy project to help me practice software development skills for ML.

# 1. Setup

Download sample data by running `src/data/get_data.sh`. 

Install the required packages via

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then install the project as a python package

```bash
$ pip3 install -e .
```

# 2. Train the model

```bash
$ python3 -m main train $TRAIN_DIR
```

Where `$TRAIN_DIR` indicates the path of the .csv file to be used for training.

# 3. Prediction

```bash
$ python3 -m main predict $example
```

Where `$example` is the string to be predicted.

# 4. Evaluation

Evaluate an already trained model.

```bash
$ python3 -m main evaluate $TEST_DIR
```

Where `$TEST_DIR` indicates the path of the .csv file to be used for testing. 
The evaluation results will be printed to the standard output and saved in `reports/`.
